The Skill Tree app uses React within Rails and a PostgreSQL database.
Please note the following versions:
- Ruby: 2.6.3
- Rails: 5.2.3
- pSQL: 11.3

The key outcomes for this application are to provide a more clear picture of the level of knowledge and understanding a software developer or designer has in their craft for two key roles. First, the developer benefits from knowing where they are in their journey towards mastery. Second, anyone looking to hire the developer benefits from knowing the areas and depth of expertise a candidate has.
